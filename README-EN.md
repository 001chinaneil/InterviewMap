## Foreword

> When you are old, looking back the whole lifetime, you will find out: When to study abroad, when to decide the first occupation, when to choose the other half to fall in love, when to marry, all these are actually great changes in fate. We were just standing at the three-forked intersection and seeing the wind blows the clouds and sails. The day you made your choice was quite dull and peaceful in the diary and it was thought to be an ordinary day in life. A project to change the interview — Interview Map.


The best job-hopping seasons, September and October are coming（For Chinese, there is an idiom called "Golden September and Silver October”）, most people must be eager to try and prepare to challenge better job opportunities. Then, the interview must definitely be the biggest challenge.

For the interview, the usual accumulation of learing is definitely necessary, but the preparation before the interview is also crucial.

A few months ago, I personally set up a small team. It took half a year to write the content and translate it into English. Today, we finally open source the first version.

These are the knowledge points that I thought good in the process of learning programming., including CSS, JS, network, browser related, performance optimization, security, framework, Git, data structure, algorithm, operating system, etc. I hope this interview map can help you better prepare for the interview.

The contents of the repository will update continuously, and more contents will be added into the repository later , such as: system design, blockchain, operation and maintenance, backend, etc. Of course, these are not my strengths, I will invite friends in this area to write content. .
